Internet programming project
============

Project files for our project in the course IK2218 (ipop13).

#### Description

The goal of the project was to create a client- and server application for playing Checkers online.
Features include, but are not limited to, hosting game sessions and chatting.
We wrote our own application layer protocol, which was slightly inspired by the IRC protocol.
